* Provision the instances with any built-in Vagrant provisioner.

## Installation

Install using standard Vagrant plugin installation methods.

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-openbsd-provider
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you use it with `vagrant up` by specifing
the `rackspace` provider:

$ vagrant up --provider=openbsd-provider
```
